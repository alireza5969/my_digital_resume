Hey there!

I'm Alireza Sadeghi, a medical doctor working as a family physician at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

I have a range of skills and experience in the medical field. I'm skilled in designing clinical studies, conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, analyzing data, and programming in R and Python. Additionally, I have a knack for graphical design. 

If you're interested, you can check out my resume to see examples of my work and publications where I've applied these skills. You can checkout my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alireza-Sadeghi-14) which I've added my figures, posters, and plots there.

Currently, I'm on the lookout for a clinical research position within the US. While I'm preparing for my steps, I aim to have Step 1 and Step 2 completed before applying for a position. My ultimate goal is to match with a highly competitive surgery residency. To achieve that, I need to make strong research contributions within the US.

If you need any assistance with scientific writing, data analysis, visualization, or coding, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm more than happy to help, even if we need to work remotely.

Feel free to contact me anytime!
