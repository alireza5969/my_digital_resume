Hey there!

I'm Alireza Sadeghi, a medical doctor working as a family physician at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

I have a range of skills and experience in the medical field. I'm skilled in designing clinical studies, conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, analyzing data, and programming in R and Python. Additionally, I have a knack for graphical design. 

If you're interested, you can check out my resume to see examples of my work and publications where I've applied these skills. You can checkout my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alireza-Sadeghi-14) which I've added my figures, posters, and plots there.

Currently, I'm on the lookout for a clinical research position. I want to join a high-performance research team in the field of urogenital cancers. My ultimate goal is to become a urologic surgeon and serve my local community in my birth town Darab and have my own research center.

If you need any assistance with scientific writing, data analysis, visualization, or coding, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm more than happy to help, even if we need to work remotely.

Feel free to contact me anytime!
